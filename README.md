# Noncat

The idea of Noncat is to integrate [LangSec](http://langsec.org/) into programming languages.
LangSec regards the internet insecurity epidemic as a consequence of ad hoc programming of input handling code.
Hence, Noncat provides developers with essential concepts to prevent such vulnerabilities, i.e., parsers, unparsers, and trusted types.

Using Noncat it shall be easier to write secure then insecure code.
